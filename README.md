# Computer Vision Course Assignments

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Computer Vision course. In this course, I've learned various concepts and techniques related to computer vision, and I've implemented them in the form of assignments and projects.

## Assignments

The assignments in this repository are organized as follows:

1. [Assignment 1](/assignment1/): Description of the assignment.
2. [Assignment 2](/assignment2/): Description of the assignment.
3. [Assignment 3](/assignment3/): Description of the assignment.
4. ...

Each assignment directory should contain the source code, any necessary data, and a README with detailed information on how to run the code and what each part of the assignment accomplishes.

## Projects

In addition to assignments, I have also worked on some projects related to computer vision. These projects can be found in the [projects](/projects/) directory. Each project folder contains a separate README that describes the project's purpose and provides instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (optional but recommended)
- Any additional requirements specified in the individual assignment or project READMEs.

### Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the specific assignment or project directories to run the code and complete the tasks. Each assignment or project may require different libraries or data, so be sure to read the corresponding README files for detailed guidance.
