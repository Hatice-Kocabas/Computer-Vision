## Assignments

### Assignment 1: 2D Translation
Develop a graphical interface allowing users to place points, perform 2D translations, and display transformed points. 

### Assignment 2: Image Processing Operations
Implement gamma correction, Prewitt edge detection, and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on images.

### Assignment 3: K-means Clustering Implementation
Construct a flowchart and program implementing K-means clustering. Apply it to the IRIS dataset.

### Assignment 4: Classification and Regression Analysis
Conduct classification/regression analyses on "cars" and "heart" datasets using multiple methods and cross-validation.


## Projects

The [projects](/projects/) directory contains detailed READMEs describing various computer vision-related projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (recommended)
- Additional requirements specified in assignment or project READMEs.

### Usage
Refer to individual assignment or project directories for specific instructions. Each task may require different libraries or data, so reading corresponding README files is crucial for guidance.

## Contributing

Contribute by forking the repository, creating a new branch for features or bug fixes, making changes, testing thoroughly, and creating a pull request. Follow coding standards and guidelines.
